<h2>First Entry</h2>
<p>Testing out creating blog entries.</p>
<p>Here is where I say something interesting, profound, and educational.</p>
<h3>Today I Learned</h3>
<p>Today I learned a bit about hosting a static website on AWS. I added music to the website. I also<br />made the website HTTPS-enabled. There is also now a blog section if I ever want to write down<br />my thoughts publicly.</p>
<p>Here are some useful links that I used:</p>
<p>Static hosting of websites:<br /><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html</a></p>
<p>Enable HTTPS:<br /><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.html</a></p>
<p>Javascript explorer of S3 buckets:<br /><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-js-s3-explorer">https://github.com/awslabs/aws-js-s3-explorer</a></p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>Last night I also fixed my QuickRestaurantFinder phone app so it will update based on price and<br />distance again. I also added a entries count, so I know where I am while scrolling through. I used<br />it today to find lunch. It's nice because the recommendations are fast and random. It's much<br />better than Google's recommendations because the results aren't weighted based on how much<br />money the restaurants pay for advertising. There's so many restaurants that are walking distance<br />that I never knew existed. I'll make that app available on my Github, but no promises that it will<br />work on any device besides my phone.</p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>I think having a Today I Learned entry might be nice to do every entry. I try to learn at least<br />one thing a day. My bar is pretty low for learning. It can be as simple as learning a new word in<br />Spanish, or something like that. When I write down what I learn, it should stick in my mind better.<br /><em>Proponer</em> is Spanish for "to propose."</p>
